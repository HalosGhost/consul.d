consul.d
--------

Having recently stumbled upon `consul <https://www.consul.io/>`_, I have been excited to start writing configuration scripts for my various servers.
Some of these configurations are specific to specific servers of mine, but many of them are generally useful and will be used across all my nodes.

See ``UNLICENSE`` for licensing details; I doubt JSON configuration files are unique enough to be subject to copyright, but on the off-chance that the ``script`` line makes it copyrightable, these files are dedicated to the public domain.
